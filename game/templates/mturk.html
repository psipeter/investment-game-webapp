        <p>This study, conducted by researchers at the University of Waterloo (Ontario, Canada) investigates learning and decision-making in an interactive two-player game. As a participant in this study, you will be asked to complete a tutorial, fill out a short survey, then play the "investment game". The game is a two-player, turn-based game that involves repeatedly exchanging virtual coins with another human player or a software opponent. You will earn performance-based rewards for each game you play. The minimum payout per game is $0.10 and the maximum is $0.40. Participants will therefore earn <span class='red'>between $0.10 and $12.00</span> over the course of the 30 games required to complete the task. This should take <span class='red'>about 40 minutes.</span> You may “cash out” anytime after completing the first game to receive your accumulated winnings.</p>
        <p><span class='red'>Make sure to leave this window open until you submit the HIT code.</span> After you have completed the first game, you will gain access to your HIT code. When you are ready to cash out, return to this page to paste the code into the box below. Payment will be received within one week of submitting the HIT.</p>
        <p>For further questions about the study, please see the “Study Information” box below. Additional inquiries about the study or payment may be sent to Peter Duggins at <a href="mailto:pduggins@uwaterloo.ca?subject=Question%20regarding%20IGWeb%20Experiment">pduggins@uwaterloo.ca.</a>.</p>

        <p>You are invited to participate in a research study investigating how people learn to play a web-based investment game against various non-human and human opponents. The purpose of the study is to observe the strategies that naive and experienced players adopt when playing the game, with the long-term goal of understanding how the brain uses learning to make social decisions. This study is being undertaken as part of Peter Duggins’ PhD research.</p>
        <h2 class="c2">Who is Running the Study?</h2>
          <p><strong>Faculty Supervisor</strong>: Chris Eliasmith, PhD. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-theoretical-neuroscience/people-profiles/chris-eliasmith"  title="U Waterloo Profile">Director of Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, University of Waterloo</a>. Office:  Engineering 7 - 6324, Phone: 519-888-4567 x42638, Email: celiasmith@uwaterloo.ca</p>
          <p><strong>Student Investigator</strong>: Peter Duggins, <a href="http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/people/peter-duggins.html" title="U Waterloo Profile">PhD candidate. Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo</a>. Office: Engineering 7 - 6339, Email: pduggins@uwaterloo.ca</p>
        <h2 class="c1">What does participation involve?</h2>
        <p>As a participant in this study, you would be asked to fill out a short survey, watch a tutorial, then play the “investment game”. The game is a two-player, turn-based game that involves repeatedly exchanging virtual coins with another human player or a software opponent. A game consists of five turns. The tutorial and required games require approximately 30 minutes. Each game move made by the participant <span class='red'>will be recorded</span> in the website’s database for research analysis.</p>
        <h2 class="c2">Who may participate in the study?</h2>
        <p>In order to participate in the study you must be able to read and understand English and have an Amazon Mechanical Turk account.</p>
        <h2 class="c1">Is participation in the study voluntary?</h2>
        <p>Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may decline to answer any survey question(s) you prefer not to answer. You may withdraw from the study after orientation by emailing <a href="mailto:pduggins@uwaterloo.ca?subject=Question%20regarding%20Investment%20Game%20Experiment">pduggins@uwaterloo.ca</a>, providing your MTurk ID, and requesting that your data be deleted. </p>
        <h2 class="c2">Will I receive anything for participating in the study?</h2>
          <p>Participants will earn performance-based rewards for each game they play. You will be able to play a maximum of 30 games in this task. If you would like to withdraw prior to completing the task, you will receive the amount earned in each game. The minimum payout per game is $0.10 and the maximum is $0.40. Participants will therefore earn <span class='red'>between $0.10 and $12.00</span> over the course of the study. This should take about 40 minutes.</p>
        <h2 class="c1">What are the possible benefits of the study?</h2>
        <p>Participation in this study may not provide any personal benefit to you, apart from the remuneration listed above. I hope the data from the study will help build a better understanding of how humans learn to make cooperative decisions in social contexts. See the Research Details page for additional information.</p>
        <h2 class="c2">What are the risks associated with the study?</h2>
        <p>There are no known or anticipated risks associated with participation in this study. If a survey question, or playing the investment game, makes you uncomfortable, you can choose not to answer or to stop participating by closing the web browser. See above for more details on voluntary participation.</p>
        <h2 class="c1">Will my identity be known to others?</h2>
        <p>No identifying information is collected during the course of the study. Participant data is associated with their MTurk ID in a secure database, and only those investigators associated with this study will have access to the records.</p>
        <h2 class="c2">Will my information be kept confidential?</h2>
        <p>The database of participants IDs, survey responses, and game moves will be secured on a password-protected server on the University of Waterloo campus. Research published as a result of data analysis will be submitted to scientific journals, but all user data will remain anonymous. We will keep our study records for a minimum of 7 years, and all records will be destroyed according to University of Waterloo policy.</p>
        <h2 class="c1">Who is sponsoring/funding the study?</h2>
        <p>This study is funded through a Canadian Graduate Scholarship and University of Waterloo funds.</p>
        <h2 class="c2">Has the study received ethics clearance?</h2>
        <p>This study has been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee (ORE#42531). If you have questions for the Committee contact the Office of Research Ethics, at 1-519-888-4567 ext. 36005 or oreceo@uwaterloo.ca.</p>
        <h2 class="c1">Who should I contact if I have questions regarding my participation in the study?</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions regarding this study, or would like additional information to assist you in reaching a decision about participation, contact Peter Duggins at <a href="mailto:pduggins@uwaterloo.ca?subject=Question%20regarding%20Investment%20Game%20Experiment">pduggins@uwaterloo.ca.</a></p>
